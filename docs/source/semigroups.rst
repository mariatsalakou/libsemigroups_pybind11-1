Semigroups
==========

``libsemigroups`` implements several algorithms for computing the structure of
a finite semigroup or monoid. The main algorithms are 
Froidure-Pin, Konieczny, and Schreier-Sims (for groups); see the links below
for further details. 

The classes for semigroups and monoids exposed in ``libsemigroups_pybind11`` are:
